# Asynchronous Processes Documentation Table

## Overview

Create comprehensive documentation of all asynchronous processes currently running in the Bookkeeper application. This documentation is essential for implementing the Asynchronous Task Registry Manager system.

## Purpose

Before implementing the Task Registry system, we need a complete inventory of all async processes to ensure proper registration and management. This table will serve as the foundation for:
- Task Registry implementation planning
- Identifying parent-child relationships between processes
- Ensuring no async processes are missed during registry integration
- Understanding termination requirements for each process type

## Documentation Requirements

Create a markdown table documenting each async process with the following columns:

| Process Name | File Location | Process Type | Parent Process | Termination Method | Notes |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| | | | | | |

### Column Definitions

- **Process Name**: Descriptive name for the async process
- **File Location**: File path and approximate line numbers where process is created/managed  
- **Process Type**: Type of async operation (Web Worker, setTimeout, setInterval, Promise chain, etc.)
- **Parent Process**: If this process is spawned by another process, identify the parent
- **Termination Method**: How the process is currently terminated (if at all)
- **Notes**: Any special considerations, cleanup requirements, or dependencies

## Process Categories to Document

### Web Workers
- File hashing workers
- Any background processing workers

### Timers and Intervals  
- Time monitoring intervals
- Progress update timers
- Cleanup timeouts
- Performance measurement timers

### Promise Chains and Async Operations
- File deduplication processes
- Firebase uploads
- Progress tracking operations
- UI update cycles

### Component Lifecycle Processes
- Lazy loading operations
- Cache management processes
- Progressive rendering systems

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All async processes identified and documented
- [ ] Parent-child relationships mapped where applicable  
- [ ] Current termination methods documented (or noted as missing)
- [ ] File locations provide enough detail for implementation
- [ ] Table serves as actionable input for Task Registry design

## Implementation Notes

This is a research and documentation task, not a coding task. The output should be a comprehensive reference document that enables efficient Task Registry implementation without requiring extensive codebase archaeology during the implementation phase.

**Dependencies**: None (foundational research task)  
**Enables**: `AsynchronousTaskRegistry.md` implementation  
**Priority**: High (blocks Task Registry implementation)  
**Effort**: Low-Medium (research and documentation)
