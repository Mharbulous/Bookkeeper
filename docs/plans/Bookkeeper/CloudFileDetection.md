# Cloud File Detection Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

**Problem Statement:** When users drag OneDrive cloud folders into the application, the folder analysis gets stuck because `reader.readEntries()` hangs indefinitely waiting for cloud files to download. This creates a poor user experience with frozen UI and no feedback mechanism.

**Proposed Solution:** Implement a modern two-tier timeout system using AbortController and progressive timeout patterns with selective real-time user feedback. This will gracefully handle cloud file timeouts while enabling partial processing of accessible files.

**Expected Outcome:** Users will receive immediate feedback when cloud folders are detected, can make informed decisions about cancellation, and the system will process available files while skipping problematic cloud directories.

## Internet Research Summary

**Modern JavaScript Timeout Patterns (2024):**
- **AbortController + AbortSignal.timeout()**: Modern approach for cancelling async operations
- **Progressive Timeout Strategy**: AWS/Google Cloud recommended exponential backoff patterns
- **readEntries() Limitations**: Chrome 77+ only returns first 100 entries per call, requires recursive calling
- **Cloud File Detection**: No files detected after 1000ms+ indicates cloud storage hanging readEntries()

**Key Findings:**
- Modern browsers support AbortSignal.timeout() for automatic timeout handling
- Progressive timeout with cascade prevention eliminates timeout spam
- Cloud storage services cause readEntries() to hang indefinitely waiting for file downloads
- Two-tier timeout (local + global) provides optimal balance of responsiveness and patience

## Browser Compatibility Analysis

**AbortController Support Matrix:**
- **Chrome**: 66+ (March 2018) - Full support including AbortSignal.timeout() since Chrome 103+ (April 2024)
- **Firefox**: 57+ (November 2017) - Full support with AbortSignal.timeout() since Firefox 100+
- **Safari**: 11.1+ (March 2018) - Full support with AbortSignal.timeout() since Safari 15.4+
- **Edge**: 16+ (October 2017) - Full support with modern timeout features
- **Node.js**: Stable since v15.4.0, experimental from v14.17.0

**Compatibility Risks and Mitigations:**
- **Legacy Browser Fallback**: Implement traditional setTimeout() wrapper for browsers without AbortSignal.timeout()
- **Feature Detection**: Use `'AbortSignal' in window && 'timeout' in AbortSignal` for capability checking
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fall back to basic Promise.race() with setTimeout for older browsers
- **Polyfill Strategy**: Consider AbortController polyfill for IE 11 support if required

**File API Compatibility:**
- **File and Directory Entries API**: Non-standard, experimental technology across all browsers
- **Chrome Behavior**: 100-entry limit per readEntries() call, requires sequential processing
- **Firefox Behavior**: Returns complete directory at once (violates spec but functional)
- **Safari/Edge**: Similar to Chrome with sequential reading requirements
- **Production Risk**: API marked as experimental, but widely used for drag-drop folder functionality

- **AbortController Mocking**: Mock AbortSignal.timeout() for controlled testing scenarios
- **Memory Leak Detection**: Use vi.spyOn() and cleanup verification for timeout handlers
- **File API Mocking**: Mock readEntries() hanging behavior for cloud file simulation

**Test-Driven Development for Async Systems:**
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Write failing timeout tests, implement minimal solution, refactor
- **Mock-First Approach**: Mock File API readEntries() behavior before implementing real timeout logic
- **Progressive Test Complexity**: Start with simple timeouts, add cascade prevention, add cleanup validation

**Subtasks:**

- [ ] Failing tests written for all timeout scenarios before implementation
- [ ] Mock File API simulates cloud folder readEntries() hanging
- [ ] Memory leak tests verify complete AbortController cleanup
- [ ] Browser compatibility tests cover older browser fallbacks
- [ ] Tests use fake timers for deterministic 1s/15s timeout behavior

**Rollback Strategy:** Remove test files if implementation approach changes significantly.

### Step 3: Timeout System Design Update
**Complexity:** Low | **Breaking Risk:** Low | **Duration:** 1 hour

**Objective:** Update `useFolderTimeouts.js` to implement modern two-tier timeout architecture.

**Subtasks:**

- [ ] Skipped folders tracked in reactive array
- [ ] Progress messages update selectively (skip notifications only)
- [ ] Cascade prevention prevents multiple timeout messages
- [ ] Browser fallback works for AbortSignal.timeout() unavailable
- [ ] All Step 2 tests pass

**Rollback Strategy:** Revert to original progress rate monitoring system.

### Step 4: readDirectoryRecursive Enhancement

- **Low Risk Files**: `FileUpload.vue`, upload components (use public APIs only)
- **Medium Risk Files**: `useFolderOptions.js` (direct integration with queue functions)
- **Zero Risk Files**: Worker files, utilities (no dependency on queue structure)

**Testing Strategy for Decomposition:**
- **API Contract Testing**: Automated validation that all public functions work identically
- **Integration Testing**: Full upload flow testing with decomposed files
- **Performance Validation**: Baseline comparison to ensure no performance regression
- **Memory Usage**: Verify no additional memory overhead from module separation

**Rollback Strategy for File Decomposition:**
- **Git Backup**: Create feature branch before decomposition starts
- **File Restoration**: Simple git revert to restore monolithic files
- **Dependency Restoration**: No consumer files need changes during rollback
- **Validation**: Run existing test suite to confirm restoration success
