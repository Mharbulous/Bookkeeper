# Cloud File Detection MVP - Time-Based Warning System

## Problem Statement

The current file upload system works perfectly for locally stored files, but hangs when processing cloud-based on-demand files (OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.) because:

1. **Hash Calculation Dependency**: Deduplication requires SHA-256 hash calculations that can only be performed on locally stored files
2. **Browser Security Limitations**: Web apps cannot directly detect whether files are stored locally or in the cloud
3. **User Experience**: Users get stuck in long processing delays without understanding why

## MVP Solution Overview

Instead of trying to technically resolve cloud file processing, we'll implement a **time-based detection system** that warns users when processing takes longer than estimated, indicating potential cloud file issues.

### Core Strategy

- **Leverage Existing Time Estimates**: Our folder analyzer already calculates hardware-calibrated processing time estimates
- **Progress Monitoring**: Add visual progress tracking based on time estimates
- **Automatic Warning System**: Trigger user warnings when processing exceeds estimates by 30%
- **Educational User Interface**: Explain the technical limitations and provide actionable guidance

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Progress Bar Component

**Location**: Add to Upload Queue section in the main file upload interface

**Component**: `src/components/features/upload/QueueTimeProgress.vue`

**Features**:
- Visual progress bar that fills based on time estimate (not actual progress)
- Displays "Upload Queue" with progress indicator
- Shows time remaining and elapsed time
- Transitions to warning state when estimate exceeded

**Integration Points**:
- `src/views/FileUpload.vue` - Main upload interface
- `src/composables/useFileQueue.js` - Access to time estimates
- `src/composables/useQueueDeduplication.js` - Processing status

### Phase 2: Time Monitoring System

**File**: `src/composables/useTimeBasedWarning.js`

**Functionality**:
```javascript
const useTimeBasedWarning = () => {
  const startTime = ref(null)
  const estimatedDuration = ref(0)
  const currentProgress = computed(() => {
    // Calculate progress based on elapsed time vs estimate
  })
  
  const isOverdue = computed(() => {
    // Return true when 30% over estimate
  })
  
  const overdueSeconds = computed(() => {
    // Calculate how many seconds over estimate
  })
}
```

**Key Features**:
- Start timer when processing begins
- Compare elapsed time to folder analysis estimates
- Trigger warnings at 130% of estimated time
- Continue monitoring throughout process

### Phase 3: Warning Modal Component

**Component**: `src/components/features/upload/CloudFileWarningModal.vue`

**Modal Content Structure**:

1. **Header**: "Upload Taking Longer Than Expected"

2. **Explanation Section**:
   - "File deduplication requires calculating SHA-256 hash values for each file"
   - "Hash calculations can only be performed on files stored locally on your device"
   - "Slow processing often indicates files are stored in the cloud and being downloaded on-demand"

3. **Detection Logic**:
   - "For web security reasons, browsers cannot tell us whether your files are stored locally or in the cloud"
   - "However, the slow processing speed (currently __X__ seconds over estimate) suggests your files may not be stored locally"

4. **User Guidance**:
   - "To resolve this issue:"
   - "1. Cancel this upload"
   - "2. In your cloud service (OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.), set folders to 'Always keep on this device'"
   - "3. Wait for all files to download locally"
   - "4. Try uploading again"

5. **Action Buttons**:
   - **"Stop Upload"**: Cancel current processing, clear queue
   - **"Wait 1 More Minute"**: Continue processing, hide modal for 60 seconds

### Phase 4: Integration with Existing System

**File Updates Required**:

1. **`src/views/FileUpload.vue`**:
   - Add `QueueTimeProgress` component
   - Pass time estimates from folder analysis
   - Handle modal display state

2. **`src/composables/useFileQueue.js`**:
   - Integrate time monitoring
   - Pass estimates to progress component
   - Handle abort operations

3. **`src/composables/useQueueDeduplication.js`**:
   - Add time monitoring hooks
   - Support for processing cancellation
   - Progress reporting integration

## Technical Implementation Details

### Progress Bar Logic

```javascript
// In QueueTimeProgress.vue
const progressPercentage = computed(() => {
  if (!startTime.value || !estimatedDuration.value) return 0
  
  const elapsed = Date.now() - startTime.value
  const progress = Math.min((elapsed / estimatedDuration.value) * 100, 100)
  
  return Math.round(progress)
})

const isOverdue = computed(() => {
  if (!startTime.value || !estimatedDuration.value) return false
  
  const elapsed = Date.now() - startTime.value
  return elapsed > (estimatedDuration.value * 1.3) // 30% over estimate
})
```

### Modal Trigger System

```javascript
// In useTimeBasedWarning.js
const checkForWarning = () => {
  if (isOverdue.value && !warningShown.value) {
    showCloudFileWarning.value = true
    warningShown.value = true
  }
}

// Check every 5 seconds during processing
const startMonitoring = () => {
  monitoringInterval.value = setInterval(checkForWarning, 5000)
}
```

### Abort Functionality

```javascript
// Handle user clicking "Stop Upload"
const abortProcessing = async () => {
  // Cancel any running workers
  workerManager.terminateAllWorkers()
  
  // Clear file queue
  fileQueue.value = []
  
  // Reset UI state
  resetProcessingState()
  
  // Close modal
  showCloudFileWarning.value = false
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### Normal Processing (Local Files)
1. User selects files/folder
2. Folder analysis completes with time estimate
3. User clicks "Continue"
4. Progress bar fills smoothly over estimated time
5. Processing completes normally

### Cloud File Detection Flow
1. User selects files/folder (includes cloud files)
2. Folder analysis completes with time estimate
3. User clicks "Continue"
4. Progress bar starts filling
5. Processing slows due to cloud file downloads
6. Progress bar reaches 100% but processing continues
7. After 30% overtime (e.g., 6.5 seconds on 5-second estimate):
   - Progress bar shows "Time estimate exceeded by X seconds"
   - Warning modal appears
8. User chooses to stop or continue
9. If continue: Modal hides for 1 minute, then reappears if still processing
10. If stop: Processing aborts, queue clears

## Benefits of This Approach
