OK I have noticed that for file uploads When I When I look at the total files according of a folder according to Windows File explorer I'll get a number for example 2994 for the general account bookkeeping folder however when I actually run that or drag and drop that folder into the file upload centre I end up with a slightly smaller number Another similar thing is for example when I drag and draw the trust accounting folder into the file upload centre it will say 3127 new files 176 duplicates for a total of 3303 however for that same folder according to according to Windows when I inspect the properties in that folder it says 3319 eight total files and in our Properties say so something that we need to do is investigate why that is happening because if our. Something that we need to look into. Why is it that the total number of files calculated by the file upload centre does not match with the total number of files according to Windows File Explorer properties.
