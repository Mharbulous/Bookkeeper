# Organizer Feature Implementation Phases

## Overview

This document outlines the incremental implementation phases for the Organizer feature described in `Organizer-Feature-Reference.md`. Each version adds a single, well-scoped feature that builds upon previous versions without breaking existing functionality.

## Version 1.0: Basic File Listing with Manual Tags ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

**Implementation Date**: August 29, 2025  
**Status**: Fully deployed and functional

**Core Goal**: Simple file list with manual tag assignment

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ Basic file list view showing uploaded files (filename, extension, upload date)
- ‚úÖ Manual tag assignment interface - users can type tags for each file
- ‚úÖ Simple tag display (text-based, no colors)
- ‚úÖ Basic search/filter by tag text
- ‚úÖ Uses existing upload system and file storage

**Implementation Scope**:
- ‚úÖ New "Organizer" view in navigation - Added to router and sidebar
- ‚úÖ File list component using Evidence collection with displayCopy references - Card-based layout
- ‚úÖ Tag input interface for human tags (tagsByHuman array) - TagInput.vue with keyboard shortcuts
- ‚úÖ Evidence documents reference originalMetadata for display names - Store fetches and caches display info
- ‚úÖ Basic text-based filtering combining tagsByAI and tagsByHuman - Real-time search in store

**User Flow** (Implemented):
1. ‚úÖ User navigates to Organizer view
2. ‚úÖ Sees list of evidence documents with display names from displayCopy references
3. ‚úÖ Clicks on a file to add human tags (tagsByHuman array)
4. ‚ùå ~~Can optionally change display name via dropdown~~ **REMOVED:** Single displayCopy sufficient for v1.0
5. ‚úÖ Can filter file list by typing tag names (searches both AI and human tags)

**Architecture Implemented**:
- **Evidence Collection**: `/teams/{teamId}/evidence/` with refined structure
- **Display Info Caching**: Store caches originalMetadata lookups for performance  
- **Real-time Updates**: Firestore listeners provide instant visibility after upload
- **Upload Integration**: Evidence documents created automatically during upload process
- **Modern UI**: Vuetify card-based responsive layout with loading states

**Key Files Created**:
- `src/features/organizer/stores/organizer.js` (341 lines)
- `src/features/organizer/views/Organizer.vue` (enhanced)
- `src/features/organizer/components/TagInput.vue`
- `src/features/organizer/services/evidenceService.js`

## Version 1.0.1: Quick Enhancements (Optional Minor Release)

**Core Goal**: Iterate quickly on Version 1.0 based on user feedback

**New Features**:
- Bulk tag operations (select multiple files for batch tagging)
- Tag autocomplete and recent tags list
- Enhanced search with OR logic (find files with any of multiple tags)
- Empty states and better loading indicators
- Improved tag input UX (keyboard shortcuts, better validation)

**Implementation Scope**:
- Multi-select interface for file list
- Autocomplete component for tag input
- Enhanced search logic supporting multiple terms

- UX polish and accessibility improvements

**User Flow**:
1. Select multiple files using checkboxes or Ctrl+click
2. Apply tags to all selected files at once
3. Use autocomplete for faster tag entry
4. Search for files using multiple tag names (OR logic)
5. See helpful messages when no files match filters

**Timeline**: 1 week after v1.0 launch (based on user feedback)

**Rationale**: Low-risk, high-value additions that ship quickly based on initial user feedback

## Version 1.1: Category-Based Tag System ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

**Implementation Date**: August 30, 2025  
**Status**: Fully deployed and functional tested

**Core Goal**: Structure tags into user-defined categories

**New Features**:
- ‚úÖ Category creation interface (user defines category names like "Document Type", "Date")
- ‚úÖ Tags now belong to categories instead of being free-form text
- ‚úÖ Category management (add/edit/delete categories)
- ‚úÖ Tag assignment limited to predefined category options
- ‚úÖ Color coding by category (simple distinct colors)
- ‚úÖ Mutual exclusivity within categories (one tag per category per document)
- ‚úÖ Default category creation for first-time users

**Implementation Scope**:
- ‚úÖ Category management interface with full CRUD operations
- ‚úÖ Update tag storage to include category reference (structured tagsByHuman)
- ‚úÖ Color assignment system for categories with consistent visual theming
- ‚úÖ Modified tag assignment UI to show category dropdowns instead of free-form text
- ‚úÖ Real-time category synchronization between management and assignment interfaces

**User Flow** (Implemented):
1. ‚úÖ System creates 3 default categories on first visit (Document Type, Date/Period, Institution)
2. ‚úÖ User can create additional categories with custom names and colors
3. ‚úÖ Each category contains predefined tag options with consistent color coding
4. ‚úÖ Tags files by selecting from category dropdown options (TagSelector replaces TagInput)
5. ‚úÖ Files display with color-coded tags grouped by category
6. ‚úÖ Mutual exclusivity enforced - selecting new tag from same category replaces previous

**Architecture Implemented**:
- **Store Decomposition**: Original 354-line organizer.js decomposed into 4 focused stores
- **Category Service**: Comprehensive CRUD operations with validation and error handling
- **TagSelector Component**: Category-based interface replacing free-form TagInput
- **Real-time Sync**: Changes in category management immediately available in tag assignment
- **Data Migration**: Backward compatibility with legacy v1.0 tags preserved

**Key Files Created**:
- `src/features/organizer/stores/categoryStore.js` (267 lines)
- `src/features/organizer/stores/tagStore.js` (264 lines) 
- `src/features/organizer/stores/migrationStore.js` (296 lines)
- `src/features/organizer/stores/organizerCore.js` (289 lines)
- `src/features/organizer/services/categoryService.js` (324 lines)
- `src/features/organizer/components/TagSelector.vue` (replacement for TagInput)
- `src/features/organizer/views/CategoryManager.vue` (category management interface)

**Future Enhancement Identified**: 
- **Configurable Mutual Exclusivity**: Allow users to configure per-category whether tags are mutually exclusive or allow multiple tags per document

---

## Version 1.1.1: Configurable Category Behaviors (Optional Enhancement)

**Core Goal**: Allow users to configure category behavior (mutual exclusivity vs. multiple tags)

**New Features**:
- Per-category configuration for tag behavior (exclusive vs. multiple allowed)
- UI toggles in category creation/editing forms

- Update TagSelector to respect category behavior settings
- Enhanced CategoryManager with behavior toggles
- Visual badges/icons indicating category behavior type
- Migration logic for existing documents when behavior changes

**User Flow**:
1. User creates/edits category with "Allow Multiple Tags" toggle
2. Categories with multiple tags enabled show visual indicator
3. TagSelector allows multiple tag selection for multi-tag categories
4. Single-tag categories maintain current mutual exclusivity behavior
5. Changing behavior offers to migrate existing document tags

**Use Cases**:
- Document Type: Single tag (mutual exclusive) - "Invoice" OR "Statement"
- Keywords: Multiple tags allowed - "urgent", "client-meeting", "follow-up"  
- Institution: Could be either depending on user preference
- Date/Period: Typically single tag but user might want "Q1" AND "January"

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks (enhancement to existing v1.1 foundation)
