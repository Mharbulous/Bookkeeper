# Cloud File Detection MVP - Time-Based Warning System

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: Current file upload system hangs when processing cloud-based on-demand files (OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.) because SHA-256 hash calculations require locally stored files, leaving users stuck without understanding why processing is slow.

**Solution**: Implement a time-based detection system that monitors processing duration against hardware-calibrated estimates and warns users when processing exceeds estimates by 30%, providing educational guidance and actionable resolution steps.

**Approach**: Leverage existing time estimation infrastructure to create progress visualization and warning modals that educate users about local vs cloud storage implications while providing a path to resolution.

## Problem Statement

The current file upload system works perfectly for locally stored files, but hangs when processing cloud-based on-demand files (OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.) because:

1. **Hash Calculation Dependency**: Deduplication requires SHA-256 hash calculations that can only be performed on locally stored files
2. **Browser Security Limitations**: Web apps cannot directly detect whether files are stored locally or in the cloud  
3. **User Experience**: Users get stuck in long processing delays without understanding why

## Key Files Analysis

- `src/views/FileUpload.vue` (276 lines) - Main upload interface, requires progress component integration
- `src/composables/useFileQueue.js` (261 lines) - File queue management, needs time monitoring hooks
- `src/composables/useQueueDeduplication.js` (61 lines) - Deduplication processing, requires monitoring integration

## Internet Research Summary

**Vue 3 Progress Bar Best Practices (2025):**
- Modern implementations use Composition API with reactive progress tracking and client-side validation
- Cleanup management essential: use `onBeforeUnmount()` to clear intervals preventing memory leaks
- VueUse provides well-written composables for timer management and interval handling
- Dynamic return patterns allow composables to return single values or control objects based on complexity needs

**Vue 3 Modal Accessibility Standards:**
- Required ARIA attributes: `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`
- Focus management critical: trap keyboard focus within modal, move to first interactive element
- Promise-based modal handling recommended for complex async operations
- Screen reader support via `aria-modal="true"` ensures only modal content is reachable

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Time-Based Progress Component
**File**: `src/components/features/upload/QueueTimeProgress.vue` (new file, ~80 lines)

**Success Criteria**:
- Visual progress bar fills based on time estimate (not actual file progress)
- Shows elapsed time and time remaining with live updates
- Displays warning state when estimate exceeded by 30%
- Updates every second with smooth animations
- Handles edge cases (no estimate, zero duration, negative values)

**Complexity**: Medium (requires Vue 3 Composition API with reactive time calculations)

**Breaking Risk**: Low (new component, no existing functionality modified)

### Step 2: Implement Time Monitoring Composable  
**File**: `src/composables/useTimeBasedWarning.js` (new file, ~120 lines)

**Success Criteria**:
- Tracks elapsed time from processing start to completion
- Compares elapsed time against folder analysis estimates
- Triggers warning state at 130% of estimated duration
- Provides computed progress percentage and overdue calculations
- Includes proper cleanup with `onBeforeUnmount()` to prevent memory leaks
- Supports start/stop/reset operations with state persistence

**Complexity**: High (complex time calculations, state management, lifecycle handling)

**Breaking Risk**: Low (new composable, isolated functionality)

**Roll-back Mechanism**: Remove new composable file, no impact on existing system

### Step 3: Create Accessible Warning Modal Component
**File**: `src/components/features/upload/CloudFileWarningModal.vue` (new file, ~180 lines)

**Success Criteria**:
- Implements full ARIA accessibility standards (`role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`)
- Focus management traps keyboard navigation within modal
- Clear educational content explaining cloud file processing issues
- Actionable user guidance with step-by-step resolution instructions  
- Two action buttons: "Stop Upload" (abort) and "Wait 1 More Minute" (continue)
- Promise-based modal handling for async operations
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop screens

**Complexity**: High (accessibility requirements, focus management, responsive design)

**Breaking Risk**: Low (new component, no existing functionality modified)

**Roll-back Mechanism**: Remove new modal component file, no impact on existing system

### Step 4: Integrate Progress Component with Main Upload Interface
**File**: `src/views/FileUpload.vue` (276 lines → ~300 lines, +24 lines)

**Success Criteria**:
- `QueueTimeProgress` component appears in upload queue section
- Time estimates passed from folder analysis to progress component
- Component shows/hides based on processing state
- No visual conflicts with existing upload interface
- Maintains existing upload flow functionality
- Progress component receives live updates during processing

**Complexity**: Medium (integration with existing complex component)

**Breaking Risk**: Medium (modifies core upload interface used by all users)

**Roll-back Mechanism**: Remove progress component integration, revert to original template structure

### Step 5: Add Time Monitoring to File Queue System
**File**: `src/composables/useFileQueue.js` (261 lines → ~285 lines, +24 lines)

**Success Criteria**:
- Integrates `useTimeBasedWarning` composable for processing monitoring
- Passes time estimates from folder analysis to monitoring system
- Provides abort functionality that cleanly cancels processing
- Exposes monitoring state to parent components
- Maintains existing file queue functionality without regression
- Handles edge cases (missing estimates, processing failures)

**Complexity**: Medium (integration with existing queue management logic)

**Breaking Risk**: High (core file processing system, affects all uploads)

**Roll-back Mechanism**: Revert useFileQueue.js changes, remove time monitoring integration, restore original file processing flow

### Step 6: Add Monitoring Hooks to Deduplication System  
**File**: `src/composables/useQueueDeduplication.js` (61 lines → ~75 lines, +14 lines)

**Success Criteria**:
- Integrates time monitoring hooks at processing start/completion points
- Supports processing cancellation without corrupting queue state
- Reports progress updates to monitoring system
- Maintains existing deduplication functionality
- Handles worker termination during abort operations
- No memory leaks from incomplete processing

**Complexity**: Medium (integration with Web Worker system)

**Breaking Risk**: High (core deduplication system affects file processing integrity)

**Roll-back Mechanism**: Revert useQueueDeduplication.js changes, remove monitoring hooks, restore original deduplication flow

### Step 7: System Integration Testing and Refinement
**Testing Scenarios**: Local files, cloud files, mixed file sets, various hardware speeds

**Success Criteria**:
- Progress bars load within 100ms of processing start
- Warning modals appear within 5 seconds of threshold breach
- Abort functionality cleanly terminates all processing within 2 seconds
- No memory leaks during extended processing sessions
- Hardware calibration adjusts thresholds appropriately
- User interface remains responsive during processing and warnings
- All existing upload functionality works without regression

**Complexity**: High (comprehensive system testing across multiple components)

**Breaking Risk**: Low (testing phase, no code changes)

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks

**Memory Leaks from Continuous Monitoring**:
- Risk: setInterval creates memory leaks if not properly cleaned up
- Mitigation: Implement proper cleanup in `onBeforeUnmount()`, test with long processing sessions

**False Positive Warnings on Slow Hardware**:
- Risk: Warnings appear for legitimately slow but local file processing
- Mitigation: Use existing hardware calibration factor, set conservative 30% threshold, allow threshold adjustment

**File Processing Corruption During Abort**:
- Risk: Stopping processing mid-stream could corrupt file queue or leave orphaned workers
- Mitigation: Implement clean abort sequence, test worker termination, ensure queue state consistency

### Medium Priority Risks

**Modal Focus Management Issues**:
- Risk: Keyboard navigation could escape modal or skip important elements
- Mitigation: Implement proper ARIA attributes, test with screen readers, validate focus trap behavior

**Progress Calculation Edge Cases**:
- Risk: Division by zero, negative time values, or missing estimates could break progress display
- Mitigation: Add defensive programming, handle edge cases explicitly, provide fallback values
