# Legacy Estimate System Cleanup - COMPLETED ✅

## Status: COMPLETED

This cleanup plan has been successfully implemented. All Trial 5 prediction constants and legacy estimation code have been removed from the codebase.

## What Was Cleaned Up

### Code Changes ✅
- ✅ Removed Trial 5 prediction constants from `src/utils/fileAnalysis.js`
- ✅ Removed legacy calculation logic and complex breakdown objects
- ✅ Simplified return object properties (`timeMs/timeSeconds` instead of dual systems)
- ✅ Removed `calculateStandardProcessingTime()` fallback function
- ✅ Simplified `analyzeFiles()` function signature (removed options parameter)
- ✅ Updated `FolderOptionsDialog.vue` to use new API properties

### Documentation Updates ✅
- ✅ Updated `CLAUDE.md` to remove all Trial 5 references and formulas
- ✅ Replaced with hardware calibration system documentation
- ✅ Removed legacy console logging documentation

### Legacy Comment Cleanup ✅
- ✅ Updated comments to reflect current hardware calibration system
- ✅ Removed references to "legacy timing" and "Trial 5"
- ✅ Replaced with appropriate hardware-calibrated descriptions

### Legacy File Archival ✅
- ✅ Created archive plan for legacy speed test files
- ✅ Documented files to be archived vs. kept for current system

## Benefits Achieved

- **Reduced complexity**: ~100+ lines of legacy prediction code removed
- **Single source of truth**: Only H-factor predictions remain
- **Cleaner API**: Simplified function signatures and return objects  
- **Better maintainability**: One prediction system to maintain and improve
- **No negative constants**: Eliminated mathematical edge cases
- **Hardware-adaptive**: System now adapts to actual hardware performance

## Current System

The codebase now focuses entirely on the **Hardware-Calibrated Prediction System**:
- Automatic H-factor measurement during folder analysis
- Hardware-specific calibration multipliers
- Continuous learning from actual performance data
- No fallback to legacy static formulas
