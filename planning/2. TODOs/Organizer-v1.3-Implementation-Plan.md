# Organizer v1.3 Implementation Plan: Virtual Folder View

**Version**: 1.3  
**Status**: 📋 **PLANNING**  
**Dependencies**: Organizer v1.1 (✅ Completed August 30, 2025)  
**Target Timeline**: 2-3 weeks  

---

## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
The current Organizer v1.1 provides excellent category-based tagging with color-coded organization, but users still need to scroll through flat file lists to find documents. For large document collections, users want the familiar experience of browsing through folder hierarchies while maintaining the flexibility of the tag-based system.

### Proposed Solution
Transform the flat tag-based view into dynamic virtual folder structures where users can:
1. Right-click any tag to create instant folder hierarchies
2. Navigate through breadcrumb-based folder structures
3. Switch seamlessly between flat and folder views
4. Reorganize folder hierarchies instantly without data processing

### Key Benefits
- **Familiar Navigation**: Users get traditional folder browsing experience
- **Instant Reorganization**: Change folder hierarchy without data processing delays
- **Contextual Filtering**: Folder views show only relevant files and tags
- **Dual View Support**: Maintain both flat and folder views for different workflows
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start broad, narrow down through folder navigation

### Internet Research Summary

**Vue.js Tree Navigation and Virtual Scrolling Best Practices (2024-2025):**

- **Modern Tree Components**: Vue ecosystem offers mature solutions like PrimeVue VirtualScroller and Radix Vue TreeVirtualizer for handling large datasets with tree virtualization
- **Performance Improvements**: Vue 3.4/3.5 brought significant performance gains with rewritten template parser and improved reactivity system, reducing memory usage for hierarchical data
- **Virtual Scrolling Solutions**: Vuetify Virtual Scroller component and PrimeVue's lazy loading patterns provide proven approaches for rendering large amounts of data efficiently
- **Navigation Patterns**: Modern implementations support full keyboard navigation, multiple selection, and adhere to Tree WAI-ARIA design patterns
- **Optimization Techniques**: Tree shaking, lazy loading, and virtual scrolling are essential for performance with large hierarchical datasets in 2025
- **Memory Management**: Virtual scrolling solutions handle dynamic heights and memory usage efficiently when dealing with large tree structures

### Key Files and Current State
- **Organizer.vue** (195 lines) - Main organizer view requiring dual view mode integration
- **FileItem.vue** (191 lines) - File display component requiring folder view enhancements  
- **TagSelector.vue** (303 lines) - **CRITICAL: Exceeds 300-line limit, must be decomposed before implementation**
- **FileListDisplay.vue** (115 lines) - List display component requiring folder view integration
- **organizerCore.js** (241 lines) - Core store to be enhanced with folder view state management

## Core Goals

1. **Implement virtual folder view** that presents tag-based data as folder hierarchies
2. **Add seamless view switching** between flat and folder modes
3. **Create dynamic folder hierarchies** based on tag category selections
4. **Build intuitive navigation** with breadcrumbs and context-aware filtering
5. **Maintain performance** with instant reorganization capabilities

## User Stories

### Virtual Folder Navigation Stories
- **As a user, I want to create folder views by right-clicking tags** so I can browse documents in a familiar folder structure
- **As a user, I want to drill down through multiple folder levels** so I can narrow down to specific document sets
- **As a user, I want breadcrumb navigation** so I can easily navigate back through folder hierarchies
- **As a user, I want to instantly reorganize folder hierarchies** so I can experiment with different organizational schemes
- **As a user, I want to switch between flat and folder views** so I can use the best view for my current task

### Contextual Filtering Stories
- **As a user, I want to see only relevant tags in folder view** so I'm not overwhelmed with unrelated tags
- **As a user, I want folder counts** so I can see how many documents are in each folder before drilling down
- **As a user, I want to maintain my place in folder navigation** when performing actions like tag assignment
- **As a user, I want to bookmark frequently used folder configurations** for quick access to common organizational schemes

## Technical Architecture

### Prerequisites: TagSelector Component Decomposition

**CRITICAL**: TagSelector.vue currently has 303 lines, exceeding the 300-line limit. This component MUST be decomposed before v1.3 implementation begins.

#### Proposed Decomposition Structure:
- **TagSelectorContainer.vue** (<150 lines) - Main container and state management
- **CategoryDropdown.vue** (<100 lines) - Individual category selection interface  
- **TagChipDisplay.vue** (<80 lines) - Display and removal of selected tags
- **TagValidation.js** (<50 lines) - Composable for tag validation logic

### View State Management

#### Enhanced organizerCore.js Store (Single Source of Truth)
Rather than creating a separate folderViewStore.js, extend the existing organizerCore.js store to maintain single source of truth:

```javascript
// Enhanced organizerCore.js with folder view capabilities
export const useOrganizerCore = defineStore('organizerCore', () => {
  // Existing v1.1 state...
  
  // New folder view state
  const viewMode = ref('flat') // 'flat' | 'folder'
  const folderHierarchy = ref([])
  const currentFolderPath = ref([])
  const breadcrumbs = computed(() => generateBreadcrumbs(currentFolderPath.value))
  
  // Virtual folder generation
  const folderStructure = computed(() => {
    if (viewMode.value === 'flat') return null
    return generateVirtualFolders(filteredEvidence.value, folderHierarchy.value)
  })
  
  const currentFolderFiles = computed(() => {
    if (viewMode.value === 'flat') return filteredEvidence.value
    return filterFilesByFolderPath(filteredEvidence.value, currentFolderPath.value)
  })
})
```

## User Experience Flow

### Creating First Folder View
1. User is in flat view seeing all files with tags
2. Right-clicks on any tag (e.g., "Statement")
3. Selects "Show in Folders" from context menu
4. View transforms to folder structure organized by that tag's category
5. User sees folder containing all "Statement" documents

### Multi-Level Navigation
1. User is in "Document Type" folder view
2. Right-clicks on "Q3 2024" tag within a statement file
3. Selects "Add Date to Folders" (or similar)
4. Folder view reorganizes to Type → Date hierarchy
5. User can navigate: All → Statements → Q3 2024 → [files]

### Instant Reorganization
1. User has Type → Date folder hierarchy
2. Decides they want Date → Type instead
3. Uses hierarchy selection dialog or right-click option
4. View instantly reorganizes without data processing
5. New path: All → Q3 2024 → Statements → [same files]

### Switching Between Views
1. User is deep in folder hierarchy: Type → Date → Institution
2. Wants to see comprehensive tag view for a file
3. Clicks "Flat View" toggle
4. Returns to flat view with full tag display
5. Can return to folder view and resume where left off

## Data Integration

### Client-Side Folder Generation
All folder operations will be performed client-side using existing v1.1 evidence data:

```javascript
// Use existing evidence from organizerCore.js store
const folderContents = computed(() => {
  return generateClientSideFolders(
    organizerCore.filteredEvidence, 
    currentHierarchy.value,
    currentFolderPath.value
  )
})

// Leverage existing category and tag data
const availableHierarchies = computed(() => {
  return categoryStore.categories.map(cat => ({
    id: cat.id,
    name: cat.name,
    color: cat.color
  }))
})
```

### Integration with Existing Services
- **evidenceService.js**: Continue using existing evidence loading and updates
- **categoryService.js**: Leverage existing category management for hierarchy options
- **organizerCore.js**: Extend with folder view state management

## Performance Considerations

### Folder Generation Optimization
- Cache folder structures for common hierarchies
- Lazy load subfolder contents until navigation
- Use indexed queries for folder counting
- Debounce hierarchy reorganization

### Memory Management
- Virtual scrolling for large folder contents
- Unload deep folder cache when not in use
- Efficient breadcrumb state management
- Optimize folder count calculations

### User Experience Performance
- Instant view switching with cached states
- Progressive loading for complex hierarchies
- Skeleton loading for folder contents
- Optimistic UI updates for navigation

## Testing Strategy
