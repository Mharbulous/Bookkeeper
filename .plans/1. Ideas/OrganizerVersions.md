- Example formatting for Gemini context
- Classification history tracking

**User Flow**:
1. AI first pass: High confidence files auto-tagged
2. AI second pass: Medium confidence files processed with context examples
3. Only remaining uncertain files go to human review
4. System progressively gets better as more examples accumulate

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Principles
- Each version is fully functional and deployable
- No breaking changes to previous functionality
- User can upgrade incrementally and see immediate value
- Simple implementations preferred over complex optimizations

### Technical Approach
- Build on existing Vue 3/Vuetify architecture
- Leverage existing Firebase infrastructure
- Use existing authentication and team isolation
- Follow established component patterns

### Quality Assurance
- Each version includes comprehensive testing
- User acceptance testing before moving to next version
- Performance benchmarking for scalability features
- Legal workflow validation for BATES numbering features

### Timeline Considerations
- Version 1.0-1.2: Core foundation (2-3 weeks each)
- Version 1.3-1.5: AI integration (3-4 weeks each) 
- Version 1.6-1.7: User interface enhancements (2 weeks each)
- Version 1.8+: Advanced features (2-4 weeks each)

This phased approach ensures users get value from early versions while building toward the complete feature set described in the reference document.
